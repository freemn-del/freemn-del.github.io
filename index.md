# INTRODUCTION TO ETHICAL HACKING {01}

## The information security law or standard

- **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)**: This U.S. federal law was enacted in response to corporate accounting scandals (e.g., Enron, WorldCom) to improve the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting. It establishes requirements for financial disclosures, internal controls, and auditing practices to prevent accounting errors and fraudulent activities, thus protecting stakeholders and the public.

- **ISO/IEC 27001:2013**: This is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS) that provides a framework for managing and protecting sensitive information.

- **PCI-DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): This standard is designed to protect cardholder information and ensure secure payment transactions.

- **FISMA** (Federal Information Security Management Act): This U.S. law focuses on securing federal information systems.

### Policies

**Remote-access policy**: This policy governs how users can remotely access the network and what methods are allowed for such access. Dial-out modems are a form of remote access, so this policy will provide guidance on whether their use is permitted or restricted.
   
**Firewall-management policy**: This policy deals with the configuration and management of firewalls. 

### Bring your own device (BYOD) 

- It's a policy that allows an employee to bring their personal devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets, to their workplace and use them to access the organization's resources by following the access privileges.
  
## SAST AND DAST
#### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

It is a type of `white box` testing method meaning they require access to source code to function. It finds all security vulnerabilities including software flaws and weaknesses such as SQL injection and others by examining code before it is deployed. SAST does not require a running system to perform evaluations.
#### DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) 

It is a type of `black-box` testing method which means that tests are performed from outside a functioning application rather than viewing into internal source code or application architecture. It is running to find a broad range of vulnerabilities by examining application. DAST requires a running system to perform evaluations.

## **DNS Record Types and Their Functions**

- **A**:  
  - The IPv4 address of the domain.

- **AAAA**:  
  - The domain’s IPv6 address.

- **CNAME**:  
  - The canonical name — allows one domain name to map onto another. This allows multiple websites to refer to a single web server.

- **MX**:  
  - The server that handles email for the domain.

- **NS**:  
  - One or more authoritative name server records for the domain.

- **TXT**:  
  - A record containing information for use outside the DNS server. The content is in the form `name=value`. This information is used for various purposes, including authentication schemes such as SPF and DKIM.

# FOOTPRINTING AND RECONNAISSANCE {02}

### NetCraft

- Obtaining information about the target network operating system. Gathering internal URL of the target website.

### Traceroute (tracert on Windows)

- This work on the concept of ICMP protocol and use the TTL field in the header of ICMP packets to discover the routers on the path to a target host
- Find the IP addresses of intermediate devices such as routers and firewalls present between a source and its destination.

### Google Hacking (Dorking)

**[related:]** 
   - Finds websites that are similar to a specific URL. For example, `related:example.com` will show websites that are similar to `example.com`.

**[site:]**
   - Searches within a specific website or domain. For example, `site:example.com` will show results only from `example.com`.

**[inurl:]**
   - Finds pages with a specific word in the URL. For example, `inurl:login` will show pages where the URL contains the word `login`.

**[info:]**
   - Provides information about a specific URL, such as its cached version or related sites. For example, `info:example.com` shows details about `example.com`, like a cached version or other information Google has about it.
     
**[index of]**
   - Displays a directory listing of files and folders on a web server. For example, `index of /images` shows a list of files and directories located in the `/images` directory of a website.
 
**[intitle:]**
   - Searches for pages with a specific string in the title. For example, `intitle:"best practices"` returns pages with "best practices" in the title.

**[link:]**
   - Finds pages that link to a specific URL. For example, `link:example.com` shows pages that have links pointing to `example.com`.

**Metagoofil** - Command line interface that uses Google hacks to find information in meta tags (domain, filetype, etc; Is a google dorks for terminal).

# ENUMERATION {03}

## Diff btw Scanning and Enumeration
### Scanning provides a broad overview of active systems, open ports, and services, while enumeration digs deeper into those services to extract detailed, actionable information.

### Net View Commands
#### Displays all the shares in the domain:
`net view / domain`
##### Displays all the shares on the specified domain:
`net view /domain:<domain name>`
### MIB (Management Information Base)

`LNMlB2.MlB`: Contains object types for workstation and server services

`DHCP.MIB`: Monitors network traffic between DHCP servers and remote hosts

`HOSTMIB.MIB`: Monitors and manages host resources

`MIB_II.MIB`: Manages TCP/lP-based Internet using a simple architecture and system

`WINS.MIB`: For the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)

### SMTP Enumeration

`VRFY` - Validates users

`EXPN` - Shows the actual delivery addresses of aliases and mailing lists

`RCPT TO` - Defines the recipients of a message

# SCANNING NETWORKS {04}
## Agent-Based Scanners & Network-Based Scanners
### Agent-Based Scanners
- Agents are installed on each device that needs to be scanned.
- Data Collection: Agents collect detailed information directly from the device and report back to a central server.
- Accuracy: High accuracy as they have direct access to the system's internals.
- Network Impact: Minimal impact on network bandwidth since data is collected locally.
- Remote Devices: Effective for devices that are often off-network, like laptops used by remote workers.

### Network-Based Scanners
- Scanners are deployed on a network appliance or a virtual machine within the network.
- Data Collection: Scans the network to identify vulnerabilities on connected devices.
- Accuracy: Can be less accurate compared to agent-based scans, especially if not using authenticated scans.
- Network Impact: Can consume significant network bandwidth, especially during large scans.
- Remote Devices: Less effective for devices that are not always connected to the network.

#### To perform stack fingerprinting with Nmap, you would use the `-O` option, which enables OS detection. The stack fingerprinting is part of the OS detection process.
### Nmap Flags:

**`-sA`**: **TCP ACK Scan**
- Sends ACK packets to determine if ports are filtered or unfiltered. Useful for mapping firewall rules. 
- Determining whether they are stateful or not and which ports are filtered

 **`-sS`**: **TCP SYN Scan** (Stealth Scan)
   - Sends SYN packets to target ports and analyzes responses to determine open or closed ports without completing the full TCP handshake.

**`-D`**: **Decoy scanning**
- Flag is used to cloak your IP address by adding decoys during a scan. It makes it harder for the target to detect the actual scanner, as multiple decoy IP addresses are used.
- This technique makes it difficult for the IDS or firewall to determine which IP address was actually scanning the network and which IP addresses were decoys.

 **`-sT`**: **TCP Connect Scan**
   - Completes the full TCP handshake with target ports to determine their status. More detectable but simpler than SYN scan.

 **`-sU`**: **UDP Scan**
   - Scans for open UDP ports. UDP scanning can be slower and less reliable due to the nature of the UDP protocol.

 **`-sP`** (now replaced by **`-sn`**): **Ping Scan**
   - Detects live hosts on a network by sending ICMP Echo requests. The **`-sn`** flag is now used to perform a ping scan without port scanning.

 **`-sN`**: **TCP Null Scan**
   - Sends packets with no flags set. Useful for evading certain types of firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

 **`-sF`**: **TCP FIN Scan**
   - Sends FIN packets to ports. Useful for detecting open ports by analyzing responses to FIN packets.

 **`-sX`**: **TCP Xmas Scan**
   - Sends packets with FIN, PSH, and URG flags set. This scan can sometimes bypass firewalls and detect open ports.

 **`-O`**: **OS Detection**
   - Attempts to determine the operating system of the target by analyzing TCP/IP stack behavior and responses.

 `-sI`: **Idle Scanning**
- A stealthy scan method that uses a third-party system (called a "zombie") to scan a target. This method hides your IP address, making it hard for the target to trace the scan back to you.

 **`-p`**: **Port Specification**
   - Used to specify which ports to scan. Example: `-p 80,443` scans ports 80 and 443. `-p-` scans all 65,535 ports.

 **`-T`**: **Timing Template**
   - Adjusts the speed of the scan to balance between speed and stealth. Ranges from 0 (Paranoid) to 5 (Insane). Example: `-T4` for faster scanning.

**`-A`**: **Aggressive Scan**
   - Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

 **`-v`**: **Verbose Mode**
- Increases the amount of output detail. Example: `-v` for basic verbosity, `-vv` for more detailed information.

 **`-oX`**: **Output to XML File**
   - Saves the scan results in an XML file format. Example: `-oX output.xml`.

 **`-oN`**: **Output to Normal File**
   - Saves the scan results in a normal text file format. Example: `-oN output.txt`.

 **`-oG`**: **Output to Grepable File**
   - Saves the scan results in a grepable format. Example: `-oG output.gnmap`.

 **`--script`**: **Script Scan**
   - Executes Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) scripts to perform additional checks and gather more information. Example: `--script vuln` for vulnerability-related scripts.

**`-Pn`**: **No Ping Scan**
   - Tells Nmap not to ping the target before scanning. Useful for scanning hosts that block ICMP ping requests or when you suspect that a firewall might block pings. It assumes the host is up and proceeds directly to the port scan.

19. **`-PU`**: **UDP Ping Scan**
   - Sends empty UDP packets to the specified ports to determine if the host is up. If the target responds (e.g., with an ICMP port unreachable message), Nmap considers the host to be up. It is often used to discover hosts that might not respond to ICMP pings but have open UDP ports.

20. **`-PP`**: **ICMP Echo Ping Scan**
   - Sends an ICMP Echo Request (ping) to determine if a host is up. This is the standard ping method, where the host replies with an ICMP Echo Reply if it is reachable and not blocking ICMP requests. . Timestamp and address mask queries.

21. **`-PY`**: **SCTP INIT Ping Scan**
   - Sends an SCTP INIT chunk to the target, which is part of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) handshake. This scan is used to detect whether the host is up by determining if it supports SCTP, a protocol used in some telecommunications networks.

## Xmas scan

- Sends packets with FIN, PSH, and URG flags set. This scan can sometimes bypass firewalls and detect open ports.

- **Open Port:** No response

- **Closed Port:**  The target typically sends a RST.

## NULL scan

- This type of scan sends a TCP packet with no flags set. 

- **Open Port**:  No response.

- **Closed Port**: The TCP stack on the target typically responds with a RST (Reset) packet. This indicates that the port is not accepting connections and is closed.

## UDP Scan

- A UDP scan sends a UDP packet to a target port without requiring a connection setup (like TCP does with its handshake). Since UDP is connectionless, the scan relies on the target's response (or lack thereof) to infer the port's status.

- **Open Port**: No response,
  However, in some cases (e.g., DNS on port 53), an open port might respond with a valid UDP reply.

- **Closed Port**:  ICMP Port Unreachable

- **Filtered Port**: No response will be received, and the status will be marked as **filtered** by the scanner.

## ARP Ping Scan

- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Ping Scan** is a network scanning technique used to identify active hosts on a local network by sending ARP requests and analyzing the responses.
- Unlike traditional ping scans that use ICMP packets, ARP scans operate at the data link layer, making them highly effective for discovering devices within the same subnet.

## TCP Maimon Scan

- The probe used here is FIN/ACK. In most cases, to determine if the port is open or closed, the RST packet should be generated as a response to a probe request. 

## ACK Flag Probe Scan

- **ACK Flag Probe Scan** is a technique used primarily to map out firewall rules and determine whether ports are filtered or unfiltered by sending TCP packets with only the ACK flag set.

### Unicornscan

- The OS of the target machine can be identified by observing the TTL values in the acquired scan result

### TTL values for various operating systems:

Windows: 128

Linux: 64

# SYSTEM HACKING {06}

### Buffer Overflow
 
- A buffer is a block of memory allocated to store data during program execution. A **buffer overflow** occurs when a program writes more data than the buffer can hold, causing it to overwrite neighboring memory locations. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious code, leading to actions like file damage, data modification, unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or gaining shell access.

## Privilege Escalation

- Exploit against a local vulnerability

## Types of Privilege Escalation

#### Privilege Escalation Using Spectre and Meltdown Vulnerabilities

- Spectre and Meltdown are vulnerabilities found in the design of modern processor chips from AMD, ARM, and Intel

# MALWARE THREATS {07}

## Components of Malware

### Crypters

Software that protects malware from undergoing reverse engineering or analysis, thus making the task of the security mechanism harder in its detection.

### Dropper

A type of Trojan that covertly installs other malware files on to the system

### Wrapper

A wrapper `binds a Trojan executable` with genuine looking `.EXE` applications,
such as games or office applications.

### Obfuscator

A program that conceals its code and intended purpose via various techniques, and thus, makes it hard for security mechanisms to detect or remove it

## Advanced Persistent Threat Lifecycle

![3](assets/20240916100622.png)
## Malware

### Trojans

- It is a program in which the malicious or harmful code is contained inside an apparently harmless program or data, which can later gain control and cause damage.
- It `create a covert communication channel` between the victim computer and the attacker for `transferring sensitive data`.

### Types of Trojans

#### Rootkits

   - This `avoid detection` by `hiding different services`,  `connections`, and `other system drivers`.
#### Viruses

   - A virus is a `self-replicating program` that produces its own copy by attaching itself to another program, computer boot sector or document.
#### Worms
   
   - These are malicious programs that `independently replicate`, `execute`, and `spread across the network connections`, thus consuming available computing resources without human interaction.
#### Fileless malware 

   - Also known as non-malware, `infects legitimate software`, `applications`, and other protocols existing in the system to perform various malicious activities
   - It leverages any existing vulnerabilities to infect the system.
   - It `resides in the system's RAM`. It injects malicious code into the running processes such as Microsoft Word, Flash, Adobe PDF Reader, Javascript, and PowerShell.
     
## Types of Viruses

### Stealth/Tunneling Virus

- These viruses try to hide from antivirus programs by actively altering and corrupting the service call interrupts while running. The virus code replaces the requests to perform operations with respect to these service call interrupts. These viruses state false information to hide their presence from antivirus programs.

### Macro Virus

- It uses macros in Office documents to spread.

### Multipart Virus

- A virus with multiple components, infecting different file types or systems. 

### Encryption Virus

- Encryption viruses or cryptolocker viruses penetrate the target system via freeware, shareware, codecs, fake advertisements, torrents, email spam, and so on. This type of virus consists of an encrypted copy of the virus and a decryption module. The decryption module remains constant, whereas the encryption makes use of different keys.

### Cavity Virus

- Also known as a space filler virus, it hides by inserting its code into unused spaces within a file, keeping the file size unchanged and evading detection.

# SNIFFING {08}

## Types of Sniffing

### Passive Sniffing

- It `sniffing through a hub`, wherein the traffic is sent to all ports
- It involves monitoring packets sent by others without `sending any additional data packets` in the network traffic

### Active Sniffing

- Is used to sniff a `switch-based network`.
- It involves `injecting Address Resolution Packets (ARP)` into the network to flood the switch's Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table, which keeps track of host-port connections

### Sniffers operate at the `data link layer` of the OSI model

### SPAN port 

- is a port that is configured to receive a copy of every packet that passes through a switch.

### Wiretapping

- Wiretapping is the process of the monitoring of `telephone` and `Internet` conversations by a third party
- Attackers `connect a listening device` (hardware, software, or a combination of both) to the circuit carrying information between two phones or hosts on the Internet
- It allows an attacker to `monitor`, `intercept`, `access`, and `record information` contained in a data flow in a communication system

### MAC Flooding

- It involves the `flooding of the CAM table with fake MAC address and IP pairs` until it is full
- The switch then `acts as a hub by broadcasting packets` to `all machines` on the network, and therefore, the attackers can sniff the traffic easily

### Mac Flooding Switches with macof

- This tool floods a switched LAN with MAC addresses, potentially causing the switch to operate in broadcast mode. 
- It is used to exploit network switches and facilitate network traffic sniffing.

### DHCP Starvation Attack

- This is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the DHCP servers where the attacker broadcasts `forged DHCP requests` and `tries to lease all the DHCP addresses available` in the DHCP scope
- Therefore, the legitimate user is `unable to obtain or renew an IP address` requested via DHCP, and fails to get access to the network

### Defend Against DHCP Starvation ==> Enable port security

### Defend Against ARP Poisoning ==> Implement Dynamic ÄRP Inspection

### Defend Against DNS Spoofing ==> DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extension)

### IRDP (ICMP Router Discovery Protocol) Spoofing

- It enables hosts to `find active routers` on their subnet. 
- An attacker can `send fake IRDP router advertisements` to trick hosts into changing their default router to one controlled by the attacker. 
- This allows the `attacker to intercept traffic, leading to man-in-the-middle, denial-of-service, or passive sniffing attacks`.

### STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) Attack

- Attackers connect a `rogue switch` into the network to change the operations of the `STP protocol` and sniff all the network traffic
- Attackers configure the rogue switch such that its priority is less than that of any other switch in the network, which makes it the root bridge, thus allowing the attackers to `sniff all the traffic` flowing in the network

### Intranet DNS Spoofing

- The attacker's system must be connected to the `local area network (LAN)` and be `able to sniff packets`
- It works well `against switches with ARP Poison Routing`.

### Internet DNS Spoofing

- The attacker `infects John's machine` with a Trojan and `changes his DNS IP address` to that of the attacker's

# SOCIAL ENGINEERING {09}

## Phases of a Social Engineering Attack

![4](assets/20240917121217.png)

## Types of Social Engineering

### Human-based Social Engineering

**Impersonation**

   - The attacker pretends to be someone else, often a trusted individual or authority figure, to manipulate the victim into providing information or access.

**Vishing (Voice Phishing)**:
   - Attackers use phone calls to impersonate legitimate entities, such as banks or tech support, to extract personal information from victims.

**Eavesdropping**

   - Unauthorized listening of conversations, or reading of messages 
   - Can be done using communication channels such as telephone lines, email, instant messaging, etc.

**Shoulder Surfing**

   - Direct observation techniques such as looking over someone's shoulder to get information such as passwords, Pl Ns, account numbers, etc.

**Dumpster Diving**

   - Attackers search through trash bins for discarded documents, hardware, or other items that may contain sensitive information.

**Reverse Social Engineering**

   - The attacker presents him as an authority and the target seeks his or her advice before or after offering the information that the attacker needs

**Piggybacking**

   - An `authorized person intentionally or unintentionally allows` an `unauthorized person` to pass through a secure door e.g., "l forgot my ID badge at home. Please help me"

**Tailgating**

   - The attacker, wearing a fake ID badge, enters a secured area by closely following an authorized person through a door that requires key access.

**Diversion Theft**

- The `attacker tricks a person responsible for making a genuine delivery` into delivering the consignment to a location other than the intended location

**Honey Trap**

- Attackers target a person inside the company online, pretending to be an attractive person. They then begin a fake online relationship to `obtain confidential information` about the target company.

**Baiting**

- Attackers offer something enticing, like a free USB drive or a download, which when accessed, installs malware or steals information from the victim's device.

**Quid Pro Quo (Something for something)**

- An attacker `offers a service or benefit in exchange for information or access`, such as pretending to be IT support and offering help in return for login credentials.

**Elicitation**

- The attacker subtly prompts the victim to reveal information through casual conversation or questioning, often without the victim realizing they are divulging sensitive information.


**Name-dropping**: This tactic involves mentioning well-known people or organizations to create a sense of credibility or authority. While it can be persuasive, it is often used in conjunction with other tactics rather than as a standalone method for swaying a victim.

### Computer-based Social Engineering

**Chain Letters**

- Emails that `offer free gifts such as money` and software on condition that the `user forwards the mail to a specified number of people`.

### Types of Phishing

**Spear Phishing**

   - A targeted phishing attack aimed at specific individuals within an organization. 
   - Attackers send spear phishing to send a message with specialized, social engineering content directed at a specific person, or a small group of people.

**Whaling**

- An attacker `targets high profile executives like CEOs, CFOs, politicians, and celebrities` who have complete access to confidential and highly valuable information.
  
**Pharming**

   - The attacker `redirects web traffic to a fraudulent website` by installing a malicious program on a personal computer or server.
   - Also known as "phishing without a lure", and performed by using `DNS Cache Poisoning` or `Host File Modification`.

**Spimming**

   - A `variant of spam` that `exploits Instant Messaging platforms` to flood spam across the networks
   - Attacker `uses bots to harvest Instant Message IDs` and spread spam

### Doxxing

- Publishing PII about an individual usually with a malicious intent.

### SET (Social Engineering Toolkit)

- This is an open-source Python-driven tool aimed at penetration testing around social engineering.

# DENIAL-OF-SFRVOCE {10}

### Hit-List Scanning Technique

- Through scanning, an attacker first collects a list of potentially vulnerable machines and then creates a `zombie army OR botnet army`. 
- The attacker scans the list to find a vulnerable machine. On finding one, the attacker installs malicious code on it and divides the list in half. 
- The attacker continues to scan one half, whereas the other half is scanned by the newly compromised machine. 

### UDP flood Attack

- An attacker sends spoofed UDP packets at a very high packet rate to a remote host on random ports of a target server using a large source IP range

### ICMP flood attacks

- These are a type of attack in which attackers send large volumes of ICMP echo request packets to a victim system directly or through reflection networks

### Ping of Death Attack

- Attacker tries to crash, destabilize, or freeze the targeted system or service by `sending malformed or oversized packets` using a simple ping command
- For instance, the attacker sends a packet which has a `size of 65,538 bytes` to the target web server. This `packet size exceeds the size limit prescribed by RFC 791 IP`, which is 65,535 bytes. The reassembly process of the receiving system might cause the system to crash

### Smurf attack

- Attacker spoofs the `source IP address` with the victim's IP address and sends a large number of `ICMP ECHO request packets` to an IP broadcast network
- This causes all the hosts on the broadcast `{FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF}` network to respond to the received `ICMP ECHO requests`. These responses will be sent to the victim machine, ultimately causing the machine to crash

### SYN Flood Attack

- An attacker floods a target server with `fake SYN requests`, using `fake source IP addresses`. The `server responds with SYN/ACK and waits for an ACK` that never arrives due to the fake addresses. This `exploits a flaw in the TCP handshake`, forcing the server to hold partial connections in its `"listen queue" for 75 seconds`. As the queue fills up, the server is overwhelmed, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
- Fill up connection buffers in the `operating system`.

### Spoofed Session Flood Attack

- Attackers `create fake or spoofed TCP sessions` by carrying multiple `SYN`, `ACK`, and `RST` or `FIN packets`
- Attackers employ this attack to `bypass firewalls` and `perform DDoS attacks` against the target network, exhausting its network resources

### Slowloris Attack

- The `attacker sends partial HTTP requests` to the target web server or application.
- Upon receiving the partial HTTP requests, the `target server opens multiple open connections` and `keeps waiting for the requests to complete`.
- These requests will not be complete, and as a result, the target server's `maximum concurrent connection` pool will be exhausted, and additional connection attempts will be denied

### R-U-Dead-Yet? (RUDY)

- Is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack tool that exploits a vulnerability in web servers by sending long-form field submissions to exhaust server resources.
  
# SESSION HIJACKING {11}

### Session Replay Attacks

- In a session replay attack, the attacker listens to the conversation between the user and the server and captures the authentication token of the user
- Once the authentication token is captured, the attacker replays the request to the server with the captured authentication token and gains unauthorized access to the server

### Session Donation Attack

- In a session donation attack, an attacker `donates his own session identifier (SID)` to the target user.
- The attacker first `obtains a valid SID` by logging into a service and later feeds the same SID to the target user.
- This `SID links a target user back to the attacker's account page` without any information to the victim.

### CRIME Attack 

- Compression Ratio Info-Leak Made Easy (CRIME) is a client-side attack that exploits the vulnerabilities present in the `data compression` feature of protocols, such as SSL/TLS, SPDY, and HTTPS
- Attackers hijack the session by decrypting secret `session cookies`
- The authentication information obtained from the session cookies is used to establish a `new session` with the web application

### Forbidden Attack

- A forbidden attack is a type of `man-in-the-middle` attack used to `hijack HTTPS sessions`
- It exploits the reuse of `cryptographic nonce` during the TLS handshake
- After hijacking the HTTPS session, the attackers `inject malicious code` and `forged content` that prompts the victim to disclose sensitive information, such as bank account numbers, passwords, and social security numbers

### Session Hijacking Tools

- Bettercap
- Ettercap
- Hetty

# EVADING IDS, FIREWALLS, AND HONEYPOTS {12}

## Types of Intrusion Detection Systems

### Network-Based Intrusion Detection Systems

- These systems typically consist of a black box that is placed on the network in a promiscuous mode, listening for patterns indicative of an intrusion
- It detects malicious activity such as Denial-of-Service attacks, port scans, or even attempts to crack into computers by monitoring network traffic

### Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems

- These systems usually include auditing for events that occur on a specific host
- These are not as common, due to the overhead they incur by having to monitor each system event

### Types of Alerts

![009](assets/pp.jpg)

### IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)

- An intrusion prevention system (l PS) is also considered as an active IDS since it is capable of not only detecting the intrusions but also preventing them
- It is a continuous monitoring system that often sits behind the firewalls as an additional layer of protection 
- Unlike an IDS, which is passive, an IPS is placed inline in the network, between the source and destination to actively analyze the network traffic and to automatically take decisions on the traffic that is entering the network

![5](assets/20240916195631.png)

### Session splicing

- Is a technique used to bypass the IDS where an attacker `splits the attack traffic` into many packets such that no single packet triggers the IDS

### Fragmentation Attack

- Fragmentation can be used as an attack vector when fragmentation timeouts vary between the IDS and the host 
- If the fragment reassembly timeout is IO sec at the IDS and 20 sec at the target system, attackers will send the second fragment 15 sec after sending the first fragment

### Time-To-Live Attacks

- These attacks require the attacker to have a prior knowledge of the topology of the victim's network
- This information can be obtained using tools such as traceroute which give information on the number of routers between the attacker and the victim

### Tethered Jailbreaking 

- With a tethered jailbreak, if the device starts back up on its own, it will no longer have a patched kernel, and it may get stuck in a partially started state; for it to completely start up with a patched kernel, it must be "re-jailbroken" with a computer (using the "boot tethered" feature of a jailbreaking tool) each time it is turned on.
  
### Semi-untethered Jailbreaking

- A semi-untethered jailbreak is similar to a semi-tethered jailbreak. In this type of a jailbreak, when the device reboots, the kernel is not patched, but the kernel can still be patched without using a computer. This is done using an app installed on the device.

- **Distributed Network Attack**: Using multiple systems to distribute the workload of cracking passwords, often through a botnet or cloud computing resources.

### PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail)
- Is a standard that provides a way to secure electronic mail using encryption and digital signatures. Although it was originally intended for email, it’s more commonly associated with file formats that store and share cryptographic keys, certificates, and other sensitive data. PEM files typically use `.pem` extensions and can store various types of data in a base64-encoded format.

### SET (Secure Electronic Transaction)
- Is a protocol developed in the 1990s by Visa and Mastercard for securing online credit card transactions. It aimed to ensure the confidentiality of payment information during e-commerce transactions, but it never gained widespread adoption due to its complexity and the rise of alternative methods like SSL/TLS.

### Key Escrow
  
  - It involves storing cryptographic keys in a secure repository (such as Active Directory in this case) to ensure that keys can be retrieved if they are lost or if recovery is needed. This process is intended to provide a backup of the keys and ensure that encrypted data can be accessed if necessary, for example, if a user forgets their password or if a system is recovered after failure.    
- To mitigate the risk of losing access to encrypted data due to key loss, while still ensuring that the data can be recovered by authorized entities, such as administrators.

## Common Tools

### CHNTPW
- This tool is specifically designed for resetting or clearing Windows passwords and enabling disabled accounts. It operates by modifying the Windows password database directly. When you boot from a Linux Live CD and use CHNTPW, you can reset or change passwords and enable accounts on the Windows system.

### Cain & Abel
- This is a Windows-based tool for password recovery and cracking, not a Linux tool. It cannot be used directly from an Ubuntu Live CD.

### Cewl
- This command-line tool creates custom wordlists by scraping web pages for relevant words or phrases. It helps gather information from websites, which can be used for password cracking or other security testing activities.

### Nslookup on Windows
- This network utility queries the DNS to obtain domain name or IP address mappings, and other DNS records. It helps troubleshoot DNS issues by providing information about the domain name or IP address.

### Tcpdump
- This command-line packet analyzer captures and displays network packets in real-time. It is used for network monitoring and troubleshooting by analyzing packet headers and contents.

### Tcptrace 
- This command-line tool analyzes TCP connections from network capture files, providing detailed statistics. It helps in diagnosing network performance issues and analyzing traffic behavior.

### TCPView 
- This command-line tool provides a real-time view of all TCP and UDP endpoints on a Windows system. It displays detailed information about each connection, including the local and remote IP addresses, ports, connection status (such as listening, established, or closed), and the associated process. TCPView is used for monitoring network activity, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and identifying which applications or services are using network resources.

### Netstat
- This command-line tool displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, and more. It is used for monitoring network traffic, troubleshooting network issues, and identifying open ports on a system.
### Dig (Domain Information Groper)
- This command-line tool queries DNS servers to retrieve detailed information about DNS records. It is used for DNS diagnostics and provides information about various DNS records like A, MX, and TXT.

### Net View
- This command-line tool displays a list of shared resources (such as folders and printers) on a network. It is used to discover devices and shared resources within a local network.
##### Net View Commands
#### Displays all the shares in the domain:
`net view / domain`
##### Displays all the shares on the specified domain:
`net view /domain:<domain name>`
 
### IPerf
- This network testing tool measures the bandwidth and performance of network connections. It is used to test TCP and UDP bandwidth between hosts and helps identify network bottlenecks.

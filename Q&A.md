An attacker decided to crack the passwords used by industrial control systems. In this
process, he employed a loop strategy to recover these passwords. He used one character
at a time to check whether the first character entered is correct; if so, he continued the loop
for consecutive characters. If not, he terminated the loop. Furthermore, the attacker
checked how much time the device took to finish one complete password authentication
process, through which he deduced how many characters entered are correct.
What is the attack technique employed by the attacker to crack the passwords of the
industrial control systems?
Ans: `Side-channel attack`

Barry, a software developer, employs a feature that automatically generates web page content without manual intervention, utilizing SSI directives. This introduces a vulnerability in the developed web application, as this feature accepts remote user inputs and incorporates them into the page. Hackers can exploit this feature by injecting malicious SSI directives as input values, enabling them to execute unauthorized actions such as modifying or deleting server files. What is the type of injection attack Barry's web application is susceptible to?
Ans: `Server-side includes injection.`
Exp:`Server-side includes (SSI) injection: This type of injection attack occurs when an application allows user inputs to be incorporated into Server-side Includes (SSI) directives. If these inputs are not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious SSI directives. This can lead to unauthorized actions such as reading or modifying server files, or executing commands on the server. In Barry's case, since the application automatically incorporates user inputs into SSI directives, it creates a vulnerability for SSI injection attacks.`

When initiating a standard TCP connection, the destination host receives a SYN (synchronize/start) packet from a source host, responding with a SYN/ACK (synchronize acknowledge). The connection is established only after the destination host receives an ACK (acknowledge) of the SYN/ACK, forming the "TCP three-way handshake." During the wait for the ACK to the SYN/ACK, a finite-sized connection queue on the destination host manages pending connections. Given this, how could an attacker take advantage of this design through a TCP SYN attack?
Ans; `The attacker floods TCP SYN packets with random source addresses towards a victim host.`

The attacker is deploying deceptive router advertisement messages to reroute all data packets through their system. Subsequently, they aim to eavesdrop on the traffic to extract valuable information from the data packets, enabling them to execute additional attacks like man-in-the-middle, denial-of-service, and passive sniffing attacks on the targeted network. In this context, which of the following methods is the attacker employing?
Ans: `IRDP spoofing`
Exp: `Inter-Site Routing Protocol Spoofing: IRDP is a protocol used in IPv6 networks for router discovery. By sending deceptive IRDP advertisements, an attacker can trick devices into routing traffic through their system instead of the legitimate router. This allows the attacker to intercept and analyze traffic, enabling them to perform various attacks such as man-in-the-middle, passive sniffing, and denial-of-service attacks.`
